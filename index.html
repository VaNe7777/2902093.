    <h1 class="text1">What is Java?</h1>

    <p class="text2"> The first is the first. We have to talk about what Java is, because, whether you already have control or are just starting out,
        <br> it is always a good idea to contextualize what we are going to talk to you about.</p>

    <p class="text2"> Java is a programming system that serves both to develop applications and to support those applications. That is, it is a full stack programming language,
        <br> which serves to shape what users see and also to support the server part, which makes everything really work. </p>
